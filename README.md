## Overview

The goal of the Fortran Astrodynamics Toolkit is to produce a comprehensive library, written in modern Fortran (Fortran 2008+), of all the standard orbital mechanics algorithms.  This is a work in progress.  Currently-implemented and proposed capabilities include:

 * Lambert solvers
   - [x] Gooding
   - [x] Izzo
   - [x] Arora
 * Kepler propagators
   - [x] Gooding
   - [x] Shepperd
   - [x] Goodyear
 * ODE solvers (with event-finding)
   - [x] Runge-Kutta
   - [ ] Nystrom
   - [ ] Adams
 * Force models
   - [ ] point mass gravity field
   - [x] geopotential gravity
   - [ ] solar radiation pressure
   - [ ] atmospheric drag
   - [ ] relativistic effects
 * Reference frames
   - [x] IAU_EARTH
   - [x] IAU_MOON
 * Celestial Body Ephemerides
   - [x] JPLEPH
   - [x] SPICE
   - [x] Analytical Moon w.r.t Earth
   - [x] Analytical solar system primary bodies
 * Alternate equations of motion
   - [x] Circular restricted three-body problem
   - [x] Clohessy-Wiltshire
   - [x] Modified equinoctial elements
 * Misc
   - [x] orbital element conversions
   - [x] halo orbits
   - [ ] targeting and optimization
   - [ ] spacecraft engine models

## Building

The Fortran Astrodynamics Toolkit and the test programs will build with any modern Fortran compiler. A [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) manifest file (`fmp.toml`) is included, so that the library and tests cases can be compiled with FPM. For example:

```
fpm build --profile release
fpm test --profile release
```


To use `Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
fortran-astrodynamics-toolkit = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit.git" }
```

or, to use a specific version:

```toml
[dependencies]
fortran-astrodynamics-toolkit = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit.git", tag = "0.3" }
```

To generate the documentation using [ford](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford), run: `ford fortran-astrodynamics-toolkit.md`

## Third-Party Requirements

A script `get_third_party.sh` is included to download and build the third-party dependencies on unix-like operating systems.

### Pyplot-Fortran

The plots generated by the examples are done using the [pyplot-fortran](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/pyplot-fortran) module. When compiling with FPM, this will automatically be downloaded and compiled.

### Ephemeris files

To use the ephemeris_module, a copy of one of the JPL binary ephemeris files must be present in the ```eph``` directory.  This can be built from the instructions at: ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/fortran/userguide.txt.  For example (on Linux):
```bash
wget ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/fortran/*
wget ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ascii/de405/*
#edit asc2eph.f file to set NRECL = 4:
sed -i '_original' '/^C.*PARAMETER ( NRECL = 4 )/s/^C//' asc2eph.f
gfortran asc2eph.f -o asc2eph
cat header.405 ascp*.405 | ./asc2eph
mkdir Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit/eph
mv JPLEPH Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit/eph/JPLEPH.405
```

### Geopotential files

To use the geopotential_module, you need a geopotential model file (for example ```GGM03C.GEO``` from ftp://ftp.csr.utexas.edu/pub/grace/GGM03/GGM03_Archive.zip). This should be placed in the ```grav``` directory.  For example:
```bash
wget http://download.csr.utexas.edu/pub/grace/GGM03/GGM03_Archive.zip
unzip GGM03_Archive.zip
mkdir Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit/grav
cp GGM03_Archive/GGM03C.GEO Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit/grav
```
